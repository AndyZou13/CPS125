Discovery Question 1
3+5+8 divided by 3 does not give the exact average because the exact number is 5.333333 but since all the values used in the operation are integers, the number 5.3333333 would be truncated to 5. This would mean that the final answer would be 5.

Discovery Question 2
The division operator will result in how many times one number can fit into another number. 3 is able to fit into 10 (10/3) 3 times which means that 10/3 would result 3. The modulus operator results the remainder of an operation. The remainder of 10/3 is 1 since 3 is able to fit into 10 three times with 1 remainder. These 2 values are different and are used in different situations.
