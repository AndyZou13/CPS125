Exercise 3:
Line 3 int instead of inx
Line 6 comma between the variable instead of a semicolon
Line 7 lowercase d in double
Line 10 logical error because dividing by 0 results error which causes a runtime error 
Line 11 double quotation befor the word The
Line 11 \n goes inside the quotations
Line 11 semicolon at the end
Line 11 %d changed to %lf for type double


Exercise 6:
1) the lowercase and uppercase 'c', the lowercase initiates char whereas Char is an error
2) it prints 0
3) t is not valid because %f specifies a float whereas the provided number is an integer
4) no it does not work if you omit the ';' after a C statement
5) %f is a float specifier and %lf is a double specifier
6) it is a logical error because you can't divide a number by 0 which results in a runtime error
7) the expression is not valid because the int modulus operator requires both sides of the expression to be integer
8) the difference is that int main(void) has a return type int and can be used to return a value whereas main() cannot
9) the placeholder does not output anything
10) 5/3 and 5.0/3 are the same but 5%3 is not the same, 5%3 is finding the remainder from 5/3

Discovery Activities
1) The difference between the printf and scanf statement is that the printf is use for printing the output whereas scanf is used to get the input 
2) The difference between int and double is that int represents a whole number where as double is able to represent decimal numbers. int uses up 4 bytes of memory and double uses 8 bytes of memory
